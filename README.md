- Wishlists

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern:
- Models: Data structures like Listing
- Views: SwiftUI views
- ViewModels: Business logic and state management
- Services: Mock data and authentication providers
- Protocols: Interface abstractions for services
